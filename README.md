# AUR PKGBUILDs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alexf91/AUR-PKGBUILDs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alexf91/AUR-PKGBUILDs)

PKGBUILDs for all my AUR packages. The packages are pushed to the AUR with
`aurpublish` and continuously tested with Travis CI in a new Arch Linux container.

Scripts for CI are located in the `.travis` directory.
