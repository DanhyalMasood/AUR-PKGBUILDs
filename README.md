# AUR PKGBUILDs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alexf91/AUR-PKGBUILDs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alexf91/AUR-PKGBUILDs)

All packages I maintain in the AUR, managed with `aurpublish`.
Packages are tested with Travis CI in an Arch Linux container. Utilities for
this task are in the `.travis` directory.
